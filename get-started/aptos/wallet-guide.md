# Create a Wallet

![](../.gitbook/images/aptos-wallet-header.png)

You must first set up a wallet that supports Aptos blockchain in order to use ZexdexApp. Both desktop PCs and smartphone devices support wallets. The wallet that best suits your needs must be chosen.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**When creating a wallet, remember to:**

- ✅ **Only download and install the most recent version from an authorized source.**
- ✅ **Strictly adhere to the setup instructions.**
- ✅ **Back up your recovery phrases in a secure manner.**
- ❌ **Never, under any circumstances, SHARE your recovery words with anybody.**
- ❌ **Never enter your recovery phrase into any other website or app than your wallet app.**

{% endhint %}

## Smartphone/Mobile or Desktop wallet?

{% hint style="warning" %}
At the time of writing, there are only a few mobile wallets that support Aptos. When more wallets become available, the zTeam will include them in the tutorial.

**We recommend using** [**desktop wallets**](./wallet-guide.md#desktop-web-browser-wallets) **until more mobile wallets are ready.**
{% endhint %}

Wallets used on mobile devices and desktop computers each have their own advantages and disadvantages. To assist in selecting the right sort of wallet, think about which better suits your needs.
