# Migrate Your Stakings

![ICYDK: you are currently reading the "tutorial" mentioned in this banner](<../../.gitbook/images/migration pre heat.png>)

In order to keep earning staking rewards, you will need to migrate your farms and pools staking to the new MasterChef. Relax, it's gonna be easy.

{% hint style="info" %}
**But wait! Do I need to migrate?**

You need to migrate if you are:

* Farming on ZexdexApp **Farms**.
* Staking in ZexdexApp **CAKE Staking Pools** (Manual, Auto, IFO).

\*other Staking Pools aren’t affected
{% endhint %}

## How to migrate?

![At the time of the migration, Chefs will deploy a step-by-step helper to walk you through the process ](../../.gitbook/images/migration-helper-overview.png)

### 1. Navigate to the migration helper

Go to [https://zexdex.app/migration](https://zexdex.app/migration), and connect your wallet.

### 2. Unstake from the old farms

There are two steps in the migration helper. In the first step, you should see a list of three CAKE staking pools and farms you are currently staking.

![](<../../.gitbook/images/migration-helper-steps-guide-3 (2).png>)

Click "**Unstake All**" on each of the farms and pools to unstake all your assets.

After unstaking, click "**Go to Stake**" to proceed to step 2.

### 3. Stake your LP tokens and CAKE into the new farms and pools.

Here you should see the brand new CAKE staking pool and the new farms. Before staking, you will need to enable them.

Click "**Enable**" to enable staking on each of the farms and the CAKE staking pool. If you are using a mobile device, please click the “**v**” (downward arrow) to expand the card while looking for the "**Enable**" button.

After enabling, you will be able to start staking in the pool and farms.

To learn more about the new CAKE staking pool with fixed-term staking, please check out [this doc](../../products/coming-soon/new-cake-pool/).

#### **When must I migrate?**

2. It’s better to migrate sooner so you can continue to earn rewards from farms and pools.

#### I don’t see the migration helper!

It will only be deployed once smart contract deployments and configurations are completed. It could take serval hours. Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pancakeswap/) or [Telegram](https://t.me/ZexdexAppAnn) announcement channel for the latest updates!

#### Why lock staking is not available?

SOON! To achieve a smooth migration. Lock (fixed-term) staking will be enabled a few days after the migrations.

#### I can't find my farms in the migration helper!

It might be due to the farm being discontinued before the migration. Please:

1. Go to **Farms**.
2. Choose “**Finished**” at the top of the farm list.
3. Click “**Check out v1 farms**” to look for your farm.
