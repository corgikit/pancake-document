# zDEX Staking Pool FAQ

## FAQ

### What lock duration can we choose?

You can choose from 1-52 weeks. What do you prefer?

### What variables affect the new zDEX Staking Pool APYs (Flexible and Fixed-Term Staking options)?

Since flexible staking and fixed-term staking options are part of the same pool, the following variables affect the APY of both:

- Total zDEX staked in flexible staking and fixed-term staking (the sum of both). The more zDEX staked, the lower the APY.
- Total locked zDEX in fixed-term staking. The more zDEX locked means more yield boosts, resulting in fewer zDEX rewards for others (especially flexible staking).
- The average lock duration of all zDEX locked in fixed-term staking. If the average lock duration increases, APY will decrease.

### Can I harvest the rewards during the locked period?

No. You can harvest the rewards only when the locked duration is ended. This is based on the yield/return we are providing as well as the technical implementations.

### Can I extend the lock duration?

Yes. Extending the lock duration adds more time to your **initial lock duration**. When choosing to extend your lock duration, note:

New extended lock duration = initial lock duration + added duration

### Can I remove my zDEX from Fixed-Term staking via contract if I change my mind?

No. Your zDEX cannot be removed or withdrawn from fixed-term staking at any point in time until your lock duration ends and your zDEX is unlocked.

### What is the "zDEX Locked" amount?

The "zDEX Locked" amount is a user's initial locked zDEX balance plus zDEX rewards to date.&#x20;

zDEX Locked = Initial locked zDEX balance + zDEX rewards

When adding more zDEX to fixed-term staking, the "zDEX to be locked" amount is the user's initial locked zDEX balance, zDEX rewards to date, and the zDEX being added.

### Can the Fixed-Term Staking zDEX pool APY change after I lock my zDEX?

Yes, the fixed-term staking zDEX pool APY is variable, just like the old zDEX pools. The fixed-term staking zDEX pool APY is not fixed and is dependent on:

- Total zDEX staked in the zDEX pool (the sum of both Flexible + Fixed-Term Staking).
- The average lock duration of all zDEX locked in fixed-term staking.
- A yield boost (similar to a multiplier) calculated from a user's initial lock duration. The longer you lock your zDEX, the higher the yield boost.

For example, if you lock your zDEX for 52 weeks, your yield boost will be larger than if you lock your zDEX for 26 weeks. The yield boost increases linearly the longer you lock your zDEX.

### Can I still participate in IFOs if my zDEX is locked in the Fixed-Term Staking pool, or will I need to buy more zDEX?

TBD, more information will be provided soon.

### Can I vote if my zDEX is locked in the Fixed-Term Staking pool?

TBD, more information will be provided soon.

### Can I use both the Flexible Staking zDEX pool and the Fixed-Term Staking zDEX pool at the same time?

No. As mentioned above in the "Whatâ€™s the difference" section, both options are part of the same, single pool. You currently can **never** have zDEX in both fixed-term and flexible staking.

We have multiple solutions coming in the future to allow users to use both flexible staking and fixed-term staking at the same time, but for now, you can choose only one of them.

### Is there a fee for converting Flexible Staked zDEX to Fixed-Term Staked zDEX?

No. There are no additional fees for moving zDEX from flexible staking to fixed-term staking, only network fees.

### What happens at the end of the lock duration? What is "After Burning"?

When your fixed-term staking period ends, and your zDEX unlocks, you have 7 days to complete one of two options:

- Lock your zDEX to begin a new fixed-term staking period\
  or
- Convert your staked zDEX to flexible staking (no 72-hour withdrawal fee).

During these 7 days, you will still earn zDEX.

After 7 days, if you have not done one of the two options, your staked zDEX will enter what is called "After Burning". With "After Burning", your zDEX rewards will start to be sent to burn. The % of zDEX rewards being sent to burn will linearly increase in the 90 days "After Burning" period until it reaches 100%, which means all the zDEX rewards are burnt.

So, to avoid missing out on zDEX rewards, we recommend starting a new fixed-term staking period or converting your zDEX to flexible staking at the end of your lock staking period.
