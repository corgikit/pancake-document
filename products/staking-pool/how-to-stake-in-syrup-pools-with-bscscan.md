# How to Stake in Staking Pools with BscScan

![](../../.gitbook/images/docs-masthead-2-%20%282%29.png)

Some users may want to take advantage of ZexdexApp's Staking Pools using BscScan instead of the website UI.

You'll be interacting with one of two contracts, depending on if you want to use the Auto zDEX Staking Pool, or one of the other available Staking Pools. This guide will help you through interacting with the contracts and get you stacking those sweet, stakingy rewards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please understand that using BscScan to interact with contracts is not recommended for beginners. If you're not feeling confident, we suggest using the [How to Stake in Staking Pools guide](https://docs.zexdex.app/products/staking-pool/staking-pool-guide) instead.
