# Other Staking Pools

![](../../../.gitbook/images/how-to-staking-pool-staking-header.png)

Staking in [Staking Pools](https://docs.zexdex.app/products/staking-pool) lets you earn zDEX or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with ZexdexApp's Yield Farms because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually zDEX.

## **Getting started with Staking Pool staking**

1\. Go to the Pools page [here](https://zexdex.app/pools).

2\. Connect to your BNB Smart Chain-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).

**IFO zDEX** automatically compounds your rewards: any zDEX you earn will be harvested and re-invested in the same pool for you. You can also earn IFO Credit during the calculation period.

**Auto zDEX** automatically compounds your rewards: any zDEX you earn will be harvested and re-invested in the same pool for you.

**Manual zDEX** doesn’t automatically compound like Auto zDEX. You’ll need to harvest and compound your earnings manually.

Other Staking Pools let you stake your zDEX to earn dozens of other cool tokens. Make sure you check them out.

5\. Once you choose a pool, click the **Enable** button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

6\. The Enable button should now be replaced with **Stake**. Click the button to bring up the staking menu.

9\. The Confirm button will change to "Confirming", then once the transaction is successful, you’ll see your staked amount change and the button will change again.

10\. You should now be able to see details on your Staking Pool. Auto zDEX will show a countdown until the unstaking fee ends. The other pools will show a **Collect** button to claim your staking rewards into your wallet.

### **Adding and removing zDEX from a pool**

You can easily add more zDEX to a Staking Pool, or move some zDEX to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked zDEX.

1\. Click the **-** to take some zDEX out of a pool, or the **+** to add more to the pool.

Please note that unstaking from the Auto zDEX pool has a fee of 0.1% if you unstake within 72 hours.

2\. A window will open. If you clicked the **+**, choose the amount you would like to add to the pool. If you clicked the **-**, choose the amount to take out of the pool.

3\. Click **Confirm**.

4\. After a little wait, you'll be able to see your new amount of staked tokens.
