# Liquidity Pools

![](../../.gitbook/images/liquidity-header.png)

You will receive Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens and share in the fees if you add your token to a Liquidity Pool.

## LP Tokens

If you deposited **zDEX** and **BNB** into a Liquidity Pool, for example, you would receive **zDEX-BNB LP** tokens.

Your portion of the zDEX-BNB Liquidity Pool is represented by the number of LP tokens you receive.

You can also withdraw your liquidity at any time to redeem your funds.

## Liquidity Providers earn trading fees

When people use your liquidity pool, you receive a reward in the form of trading fees.

When a trader uses ZexdexApp, they pay a 0.25% fee, **of which 0.17%** goes into the Liquidity Pool of the swap pair they traded on.

As an example:

- There are ten LP tokens, each representing ten zDEX and ten BNB tokens.
- 1 LP token equals 1 zDEX + 1 BNB
- Someone exchanges ten zDEX for ten BNB.
- Another person exchanges 10 BNB for 10 zDEX.
- There are now 10.017 zDEX and 10.017 BNB in the zDEX/BNB liquidity pool.
- Each LP token now has a value of 1.00017 zDEX + 1.00017 BNB.

To make being a liquidity provider even more appealing, you can use your LP tokens to generate new yield on the [zDEX Farms](https://zexdex.app/farms) while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.

## Impermanent Loss

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.

[“Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)
