# What is Perpetual Trading?

Perpetuals, also known as perpetual swaps or perps, are a type of futures contract that does not have an expiration date.

To optimize capital, futures traders can enter positions on margin (leverage) with borrowed funds. Leverage allows a user to enter a position that is larger than their account balance. A user could, for example, use 10x leverage and trade 100 zDEX for the price of 10 zDEX. The initial margin in this example would be 10 zDEX, which is used to collateralize the leveraged position.
Aside from leverage, futures allow you to trade in both directions, buying (long) and selling (short) perpetuals. Furthermore, it enables ZexdexApp to offer more assets for trading, including assets that are not currently on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Perpetual contracts do not expire and allow the holder to profit from the underlying asset's trading price action without owning it.
