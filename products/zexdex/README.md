ZexdexApp is an Automated Market Maker (AMM), and the Exchange is at its core. ZexdexApp is the most popular Decentralized Exchange (DEX) in history, and the leading AMM on the BNB Smart Chain!

The ZexdexApp Exchange provides several decentralized trading features, including:

### Swapping/Trading

Users can use ZexdexApp to trade without going through a centralized exchange. Everything you do on ZexdexApp is routed directly through your own walletâ€”no need to entrust your coins to someone else!

### Liquidity Pools

On ZexdexApp, you can only swap tokens if there is sufficient liquidity for those tokens. It will be difficult, expensive, or impossible to swap tokens if there hasn't been much liquidity added for the token or tokens you want to swap.

Providing liquidity will earn you LP Tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees for ensuring the exchange always has liquidity.

### Yield Farming

**Coming Soon**

Users who provide liquidity can earn zDEX rewards by locking their LP tokens into a smart contract. The incentive is to mitigate the risk of [permanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/permanent-loss-explained) associated with locking in your liquidity.

### Launcher

A Launcher is a one-time event that allows users to participate in a limited-time offer to purchase new tokens. The price is usually quite high.
