# vzDEX

### What is vzDEX?

vzDEX is a number representing the boosted voting power based on a userâ€™s fixed-term zDEX staking position.

The vzDEX number will be added to your total voting power.

**Similar to izDEX, vzDEX is NOT a new token.**

vzDEX IS NOT transferrable or tradeable.

### How is vzDEX calculated?

vzDEX is calculated based on two variables:

1. The amount of zDEX located in the Fixed-Term Staking Pool
2. The remaining lock durations of the staking positions

For point 2., it is important to clarify that the remaining lock duration is not (a) how many weeks you committed your zDEX for when you first locked it up (e.g. 52 weeks), but (b) the time remaining on your lock. In this case, if you locked zDEX for 52 weeks around 10 weeks ago, your remaining lock duration is 42 weeks, not 52 weeks.

If your remaining staking duration is less than one week, your vzDEX is equal to the amount of zDEX locked in the zDEX pool.

If your remaining staking duration is more than one week, your vzDEX is equal to the amount of zDEX locked, multiplied by the number of weeks left in the staking position.

For example:

- Alice locked 100 zDEX for 52 weeks; her staking position will unlock in 40 weeks. She has \`100 x 40 = 4000 vzDEX\`
- Bob locked 100 zDEX for 52 weeks; his staking position will unlock in 52 weeks. He has \`100 x 52 = 5200 vzDEX\`
- Carole locked 100 zDEX for ten weeks; and her staking position has ended. She has \`100 vzDEX\`
