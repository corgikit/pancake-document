StableSwap on ZexdexApp is a feature to trade stable pairs with a lower slippage based on an invariant curve slippage function. It is designed to swap specific assets that are priced closely â€“ such as USD stablecoins (e.g. HAY, BUSD and USDT) or liquid staking tokens (e.g. stkBNB and aBNBc).

The StableSwap is an implementation of Curve Financeâ€™s AMM on ZexdexApp. It adds linear invariant constant sum curve (x+y=k) on top of the constant product formula (x\*y=k) to keep prices more equal as long as the liquidity pool is not extremely unbalanced. As a result, since StableSwaps are restricted to similarly priced assets, impermanent loss is not as much of a concern (except in extreme depeg cases) and the slippage is lower than normal AMM which just uses the constant product formula.

When you make a token swap (trade) on the StableSwap you will pay a fee of 0.04% trading fees, which is lower than the usual 0.25% on normal ZexdexApp AMM. The fee attribution is broken down as follows

- 0.02% to the LP as rewards (50%)
- 0.016% to zDEX buyback and burn (40%)
- 0.004% to the ZexdexApp Treasury (10%)

At launch, the Kitchen will be rolling out StableSwap pairs gradually to test and improve the product further. The first pair to be launched will be **HAY-BUSD**.

[**HAY**](https://helio.money/) \*\*\*\* from Helio Protocol is a fully decentralized, BNB overcollateralized [destablecoin](https://docs.helio.money/). The reasons the HAY-BUSD pair is selected as the first are:

- Be one of the first major trading venues for HAY to absorb volume overtime
- As HAY only recently launched (mid-Aug 2022) compared to other stablecoins, the volume and operational impact from liquidity transfer is more manageable to launch on the StableSwap product
- Based on progress of this pair and community feedback, the Kitchen can gradually add other stable pairs

## **Why should I use the StableSwap instead of the normal AMM swap?**

- Swap your stablecoins or other pairs of similarly priced assets more efficiently with the same trade steps!
- With the StableSwap function, the trading slippage is lower than normal AMM which just uses the constant product formula
- The trading fees are lower compared to the normal AMM as well.

## What are some of the features that the Kitchen is still fixing and cooking?

- Better guides on UI regarding StableSwap and stable LPs&#x20;
- StableSwap information page&#x20;
- Adding more stable trading pairs, and the migration process of existing LPs

## Timeline:

- StableSwap launch and HAY-BUSD liquidity provision enabled: **Sep 22 2022 11:00 UTC**
- Farm migration (zDEX rewards redirect to from HAY-BUSD LP Farm to HAY-BUSD Stable LP Farm)**: Sep 23 2022 11:00 UTC**
