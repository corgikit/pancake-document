# New zDEX Staking Pool

## Stake zDEX, earn zDEX!

ZexdexApp now offers one zDEX Staking Pool with two staking options: flexible staking or fixed-term staking. Note that the Auto zDEX, IFO zDEX, and Manual zDEX pools will be retired upon the launch of the new zDEX Staking Pool with flexible and fixed-term staking. Keep reading on to learn more!

## What’s the difference between “Flexible” and “Fixed-Term” staking?

With both, you can simply stake your zDEX tokens to earn more zDEX tokens with no deposit fees—both staking options auto-compound zDEX rewards for you. Flexible staking allows users to stake zDEX and earn rewards with the ability to unstake whenever they please. Fixed-term staking allows users to maximise their yield and earn even more zDEX by locking their staked zDEX for a period of time they choose, earning a linearly boosted APY compared to flexible staking.

Flexible staking and fixed-term staking are both part of the same pool to allow users easy migration between the two staking options. **Because of this, you can only choose one staking option at a time.** More details about the differences are below.

### Flexible Staking

Stake your zDEX and forget about it! The zDEX you stake in this Staking Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee (same as the old Auto zDEX Staking Pool).

**If you have zDEX staked in flexible staking**

- ✅ Add more zDEX to flexible staking
- ✅ Harvest rewards any time
- ✅ Withdraw any time (fees apply for the first 72 hours, see below)
- ✅ Convert all staked zDEX in flexible to fixed-term staking
- ❌ Add zDEX to fixed-term staking if you have any zDEX in flexible staking
- ❌ Convert part of the staked zDEX in flexible to fixed-term staking

**Unstaking fee**

- **0.1% if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
- Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
- After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
- The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more zDEX in the pool.
- This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

- **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
- For example, if the harvest were 1 zDEX, then 0.02 zDEX would be subtracted as the performance fee.

The zDEX collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular zDEX token burns.

This is a good thing for zDEX holders because it reduces the overall amount of zDEX tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### Fixed-Term Staking

Stake your zDEX for a fixed amount of time to maximise yields and receive additional benefits! The staked zDEX will be automatically compounded during the entire lock duration.

- No performance fees
- The longer you lock, the higher the boost applied to the yield! Always offering a higher APY compared to flexible staking!
- zDEX rewards are auto-compounded and will unlock, along with your staked zDEX, when your lock duration expires
- Once staked in fixed-term staking, you cannot withdraw until the end of your lock duration.
- IFO zDEX credit (the maximum amount of zDEX they can commit during an IFO) will be determined from the fixed-term staking pool

**If you have zDEX locked in fixed-term staking**

- ✅ Add more zDEX to lock
- ✅ Extend lock period
- ❌ Add zDEX to flexible staking
- ❌ Harvest rewards
- ❌ Withdraw before locked term ends
