## Farms and Staking Pools

By giving zDEX to the owners of your trading pair's LP Tokens, farms encourage users to contribute liquidity.

A way to provide your tokens to BNB Smart Chain's users who stake zDEX in the pool is through staking pools.

On ZexdexApp, these two products work in tandem: once a project contributes tokens to a Staking Pool, we'll also construct a Farm. Get in contact if you want to promote liquidity by distributing tokens.

**â€‹**[**Apply to run a Farm or Staking Pool**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQNsAfh98SAfcqJKR3is2hdvMRdnvfd2F3Hql96vXHgIi3Bw/viewform)**â€‹**

- We only react to applications made through the application form, so don't send us an email to apply. &#x20;
- Please don't follow up with us repeatedly about your application. We always have a backlog of high-caliber projects that are contacting us.

### How long will it take to get a response?

Although we strive to respond to applications within a week, we are unable to do so owing to the high volume of requests. If after applying we don't get back to you in two weeks, try reaching out to [@ZexdexAppBD](https://t.me/ZexdexAppBD) on Telegram, with **the name of your project, your token ticker, and the date you applied.**

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a Core Farm VS Farm Auction

A Core Farm is usually offered to projects who have shown excellent trading volumes on ZexdexApp and have met the standards of our internal review process, while any project can participate in a Farm Auction and win a Farm slot.

### What are the qualifying criteria for Community VS Core?

Qualifying criteria for Community Farms and Core Farms/Pools are based on our internal review process. We donâ€™t publish them externally. If youâ€™re not eligible for a Core Farm, we may invite you to apply for a Community Farm instead.

### Can I get a larger Farm multiplier? Or can I extend my Staking Pool and Farm?

If youâ€™ve already got an ongoing Pool and Farm, you may be able to extend the timeline via a Boost Pool. If you wish to increase the multiplier, the team will consider it if the 30-day volume is increased. Contact us via your existing ZexdexApp communication channels for enquiries.

## zLauncher (Token Sales)

"IFO" (Initial Farm Offering) is a new model of token sale pioneered by ZexdexApp. Here's how it works, in short:&#x20;

- Users buy your token with CAKE tokens.
- After the sale, we distribute the CAKE to you.

### How can I list my token on the exchange?

Anybody can "list" any BEP-20 network token on ZexdexApp. You don't need to contact us or ask permission. You just need to [add liquidity to a liquidity pool](../products/zexdex/pancakeswap-pools.md) - that's it. Traders can then trade your token by entering your token's contract address.

### How can I add my token to the default list?

The top 100 list is generated according to the highest volume for a specific period of time. As for the Extended list: projects hosting Farms will usually be added, and other tokens chosen by ZexdexApp core team may also be added.

We donâ€™t take applications for these lists. Users can still add your token manually by entering its contract address.

### How can I add my token's logo/icon?

Please add your icon to Trust Walletâ€™s assets repo, which ZexdexApp references: [https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)

### Someone made a fake copy of my token! Can you block it?

Due to ZexdexAppâ€™s nature as an AMM-based DEX, weâ€™re not able to prevent the trading of any BEP-20 token. We recommend ensuring that your token contract is clearly visible and verifiable on your site, and educating your users about how to safely trade your token.

### People get an error when trading my token. What can I do?

Check our [Troubleshooting page](../help/troubleshooting.md) for a list of common errors on the exchange, and how to solve them.
