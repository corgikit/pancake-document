### **Fundamental prerequisites for NFT**

Technical:

- 100% minted
- IPFS or a similarly decentralized network must host metadata.

Business:

- Has established an active community

The BD team will be asking additional due diligence questions in addition to these standards, and projects will be evaluated individually.

### How long will it take to get a response?

Try contacting [@ZexdexAppBD](https://t.me/ZexdexAppBD/) on Telegram if you haven't heard from us in two weeks after submitting your application, with **the name of your project and application details.**
