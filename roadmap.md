# Roadmap

![](.gitbook/images/roadmap-header.png)

_Updated on October 23, 2022_

### It's a path, not a to-do list, to finish.

We move quickly, and cryptocurrency does too.

It's a way of life to pivot.

We can set our development priorities in accordance with market changes and developer resources because we don't publicly commit to certain deadlines.
