# SYRUP \(Staking\)

**Stack your zDEX with staking.**

- 25% of zDEX emissions will be distributed to SYRUP holders every block. Users can claim these rewards and re-invest them.
- zDEX holders can swap zDEX for SYRUP at a 1:1 ratio.
- zDEX is distributed proportionally at each block based on SYRUP holdings.
- We will only record and distribute zDEX rewards to the wallet address that initiated the SYRUP staking. While Staking can be sent to other addresses only the initiating address will receive the zDEX rewards,
